# GitHub Action Security Vulnerability Resolution

## Issue:
The `buggy-actions/expose-passwords` action contains a serious security vulnerability, potentially exposing sensitive data such as passwords.

## Solution:
We replaced this action with secure, commonly used alternatives such as `actions/checkout@v2` to ensure that sensitive data remains protected. These actions are maintained and trusted by the GitHub community.

## Testing:
All workflows were tested and confirmed to be working with the secure actions, ensuring no sensitive data is exposed.
