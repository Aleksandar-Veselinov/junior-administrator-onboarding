# Communication Strategy for Repository Health Files

To ensure repository quality, all projects must include the following files:
[] README.md  
[] CONTRIBUTING.md  
[] CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md  
[] SECURITY.md  
[] LICENSE  

If any of these files are missing, the repository may be flagged.  
For questions, contact the administrator.
