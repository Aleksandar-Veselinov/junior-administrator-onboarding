# Security Improvement Measures

## 1. Automated Code Scanning
To prevent security vulnerabilities, it is essential that all repositories have GitHub Code Scanning (CodeQL) enabled.
### Action Plan:
- Enforce CodeQL scanning for all repositories.
- Custom security rules should be configured to detect project-specific vulnerabilities.
- Automatic scans should be scheduled to identify security risks before deployment.

## 2. Secure Dependency Management
It is important to note that outdated dependencies can leave systems vulnerable to attack. Dependabot should be enabled for all repositories.
### Action Plan:
- Require automatic dependency updates via Dependabot.
- Dependency updates must be reviewed before merging.
- Vulnerable package versions should be blocked.

## 3. Secrets Management
It is imperative to eliminate hardcoded credentials (e.g., API keys, passwords) as they present a significant security risk.
### Action Plan:
- Enable GitHub Secret Scanning across all repositories.
- Store secrets only in environment variables or GitHub Secrets.
- Implement automated secret rotation for exposed credentials.

## 4. Security Alert Monitoring & Response
Teams must stay informed about new security vulnerabilities in repositories.
### Action Plan:
- Use GitHub Security Advisories to track new vulnerabilities.
- Automated notifications for security alerts should be set up.
- Create a response plan for handling security incidents.

## 5. Developer Security Training
Security best practices should be a part of the development workflow.
### Action Plan:
- Provide regular security training on GitHub's security features.
- Establish secure coding guidelines for all developers.
- Conduct internal security audits every quarter.
